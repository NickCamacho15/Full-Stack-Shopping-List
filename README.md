# Final Capstone
This is an application called "Monikas List" that allows you to create groups where you can share shopping lists and can add/remove items from your lists. Users are able to join groups that have already been created by using a uniquely generated invite code. This is a full-stack application using Java Spring Boot in IntelliJ, SQL in PostgreSQL, and Vue.JS/HTML/CSS in VS code.
